<p>In the stressful lives of corporate employees, keeping a tab on one's health often takes a backseat. Therefore, our pathlab strongly encourages the corporate 
companies to take the matter in their own hands to ensure the safety and health of their employees, thus their corporation; our corporate health programme takes care
of detecting diseases at early stages with frequent check-ups and reports.

<td>Due to stress, lack of exercise, work pressure, and poor diet, health begins deteriorating and one does not even notice. 
This is why periodic health check-ups are a must. With cumulative reports available for HR after the checkups and a health risk
assessment customized for the employee, along with a disease management programme aimed at improving employee health and reducing absenteeism, 
the corporate programme of Dr. N. Sharan Pathlabs takes care of all.
</td>
<td>Companies pay attention to their employee's health, but cannot disregard the members of their family. This is why the corporate programme of Dr. N. Sharan
Pathlabs also comprises of privilege discounts for lab tests undertaken by the employee, the employee's spouse, and the employee's children. The discounts range from 
five percent to twenty percent, depending on the rank of the employee.
</td>
<td>In many multinational companies, health has turned into a criteria for employment, to ensure that the employee has the capability to stay with the company for long.
Similarly, Dr. N. Sharan Pathlab's corporate programme involves basic investigations to determine a candidate's medical fitness for employment, giving the employer
an assurance on the candidate's health. 
</td>
<td>Employees form corporates, whereas the medical fitness of the employee forms the employee itself. This is the reason for which the corporate programme screens a
corporate's current and potential employees against a range of drugs and toxic substances, keeping the comprehensive test menu free-of-cost in this aspect.
